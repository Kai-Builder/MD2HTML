# MD2HTML: Custom Markdown
MD2HTML Is a MarkDown Parser Written In C.

MD2HTML Uses JSONSuperCharged. And Is closed source.

## How-to-Install
Download the basic EXE (MD2HTML.exe), And run it. Make sure you have a config.json File.

After, If you would like, Specify a StyleSheet.

This is how your Stylesheet would look like.

```json
{
  "stylesheet": "test.css"
}
```
Then, Run the program And Type:

```
Desktop\MD2HTML\> MD2HTML.exe
File: test.md
```

Then two files are created. One of them is a .bit File, The other is a .html file. The HTML One is your exported piece, The .bit File is the cache. To turn off cache, Go to the config.json File and put:

```json
{
  "stylesheet": "test.css",
  "do_cache?": false
}
```

After, Open the HTML File, And This is how it should look.

```html
<!---This File Was Generated By Kai's MD2HTML Generator.--->
<!--- @mdhtml:echo off --->
<!--- Start Initial Divider --->
<style>p{color:white;font-family:"SegoeUI",serif;}body{background-color:darkgrey;font-family:"SegoeUI",serif;}</style>
<!DOCTYPE html> <title>test.md</title><!doctype html>
<html lang="en">    <meta charset="UTF-8">    <meta name="viewport"          content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">    
<body>
<div class="md2html-export-os-windows">

<!--- Add a Paragraph Variable --->
<p> You can Export this document by opening <a href="MD2HTML.exe">This Executable</a> And output looks like:</p>
<!--- Add a Paragraph Variable --->
<p></p>
<!--- Add a Paragraph Variable --->
<p> </p>
<!--- Add a Paragraph Variable --->
<p></p>
</div>
<!---END---></body></html>
```
As you can see, Definitely Isn't the best Markdown parser, But it will suffice for small markdown projects. It can be used as a alternative to other markdown -> html converters, because it is faster, and works in the console.
